Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.




```{r}
simpsons_episodes = read.csv("/Users/nrittenberg24/Desktop/simpsons_episodes.csv")
head(simpsons_episodes)
dim(simpsons_episodes)


library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

ggplot(simpsons_episodes, aes(x = views, y = imdb_rating, color = season)) +
  scale_color_viridis_b() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Which Seasons of The Simpsons Have the Most Views and Highest Ratings?", x = "Views", y = "IMDB Rating", caption = "Created By:
           Nolan Rittenberg") + 
  theme_minimal()
